This is an App based around a love for sports and sports trivia 
which takes a user's interest in certain teams/Cities and creates an interactive game 
of trivia that can be played by one or multiple members or teams.
A user will login and select from a variety of sports, sports teams, sports cities, etc., which will then generate trivia
questions based on those selections. The user can then choose whether to play a solo game or 
compete with 1 or more opponents(can also be set up as teams). Once the parameters are set and the teams are recorded, the game will 
start with trivia questions, where each team will take turns choosing from categories that have varying levels of difficulty.
If a user/team answers correctly, they are rewarded the points associated with the question(based off difficulty)
and will be able to choose again.
If the user/team answers incorrectly, the question # sportsproject
